# Wiring diagrams in HTML canvas

Visualize wiring diagrams, also known as [string
diagrams](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+diagram), in the HTML canvas.
The package is written in TypeScript, provides components for React, and
interfaces with the HTML canvas using [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/).

For now, the package provides only viewing, not editing, capabilities. Layout
is handled by external tools like [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/).
